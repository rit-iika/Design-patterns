# Design-patterns
Dedicated Resources for the Low-Level System Design.
Design patterns are generic solution to commonly occuring problems in software design.
When a solution gets repeated over and over in various projects, someone eventually puts a name to it and describes the solution in detail. Thatâ€™s basically how a pattern gets discovered.

Why to learn?
1. Design patterns are a toolkit of tried and tested solutions to common problems in software design. Even if you never encounter these problems, knowing patterns is still useful because it teaches you how to solve all sorts of problems using principles of object-oriented design.
2. Design patterns define a common language that you and your teammates can use to communicate more efficiently. 

Type of Patterns:
1. Creational pattern -  provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
3. Structural pattern - explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
4. Behavioral pattern - take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

Creational Patterns:
1. Singleton
2. Factory
3. Abstract Factory
4. Builder
5. prototype

Structural Patterns:
1. Adaptive
2. Bridge
3. composite
4. decorator
5. facade
6. proxy

Behavior Patterns:
1. command
2. Iterator
3. Mediator
4. Observer
5. Strategy
6. State
7. Visitor
